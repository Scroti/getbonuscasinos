This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for displaying casino bonus information.

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure Firebase

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

You can find these values in your Firebase Console under Project Settings > General > Your apps.

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Note:** The app fetches bonuses directly from Firestore. Make sure your Firebase project has a `bonuses` collection with the appropriate data structure.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js app directory with pages and layouts
- `components/` - React components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and data
- `public/` - Static assets
